## Design Context

### Users
Established Friendship Circle chapter directors — shluchim and shluchos running organizations with $500K+ budgets. They're busy, mission-driven leaders who've built something real and are looking to grow it responsibly. They arrive at this page having already heard about the summit through their network. The page needs to confirm it's worth their time and that they belong here.

### Brand Personality
**Exclusive. Rigorous. Purposeful.**
This is not a conference — it's a curated gathering for a select few. The design should communicate that being invited is itself a signal. Warm Chabad soul underneath a premium exterior. Feels earned, not marketed.

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Reference**: Summit.co — dark photography with confident overlays, clean premium layout, peer-community energy
- **Anti-reference**: Generic nonprofit landing pages, corporate retreat vibes, anything that feels like mass marketing
- **Theme**: Dark navy base, teal as the sole accent color, Cormorant Garamond for editorial weight, Proxima Nova for clarity
- **Photography**: West Bloomfield campus/LifeTown imagery, overlaid with semi-transparent navy (not full bleed color)
- **Mode**: Dark hero, light content sections — strong contrast between sections

### Design Principles
1. **Exclusivity through restraint** — Less is more. White space signals confidence. Don't over-explain.
2. **Earned credibility** — Every design element (typography scale, spacing, serif headings) should feel like it belongs in a premium leadership context.
3. **Human at the center** — Real photography, real names, real stories. Not stock. Not abstract.
4. **Teal as signal, not decoration** — Use teal sparingly: accent borders, key numbers, hover states. Never fill large areas with it.
5. **The page qualifies the reader** — By the time someone reaches the registration form, they should feel like this was made specifically for them.

### Technical Notes
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS + JS
- Fonts: Proxima Nova (.otf files in `fonts/`), Cormorant Garamond (Google Fonts)
- Logo: `logo-color.png` — use `filter: brightness(0) invert(1)` on dark backgrounds
- Hero background: drop a campus photo into `hero-bg.jpg` and uncomment the background-image line in `.hero`
- No build tools, no frameworks
